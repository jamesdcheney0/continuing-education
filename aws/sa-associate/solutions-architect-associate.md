    - Not every video in here is required for certification 
    - The hands on labs essentially book-end the learning objectives for the week. Each week of the program will also have an email come out with objectives for the week 


## Info
- Twitch sessions are recorded. The instructor-led 4 hour courses are NOT recorded. 
- labs and tests require monthly charge. Probably able to reimburse with Octo if necessary. 
- This program is ~3 months
- Once past 85% on learning plan (in week 6), will qualify in the running for raffle for voucher
- Recommend 8-9 hours/week of studying. 1.6-1.8 hours/day of studying weekdays only. Pacing helps maintain knowledge & keep committed 
- watch for easter eggs in links in emails and weekly wed/fri chats
