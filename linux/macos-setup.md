# Notes about installation of things
- in vim, changed tab to only do 4 spaces
    - set autoindent expandtab tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4
## Docker
- had to install docker desktop `brew install --cask docker` rather than just brew install
- then had to launch the docker app, then I was able to use docker commands on CLI 
## displaylink
- Turning off hardware acceleration in Google Chrome made it so I can watch the videos!!!
