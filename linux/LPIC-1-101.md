# Introduction to Linux 
- Torvalds is still a significant project manager 
- advantages
    - linux scalability feeds cloud computing
    - physical infrastructure control
    - open source + infinitely customizable
    - cost effective
    - security & reliability
    - technical support 
## Introduction to the LPIC and AWS
- LPIC-1 Linux Service Professional Certification
    - provision & manage servers + PCs
    - requires two $183 exams: LPI 101 & LPI 102
- LPIC-2
    - administer small to medium-size mixed networks
    - two exams LPI 201 & 202
- LPIC-3
    - take one of three exams 
        - 300: Mixed Environments
        - 303: Security
        - 304: Virtualization and High Availability
- LPIC certs good for 5 years
- Linux and AWS
    - most new IT is cloud-based
    - most cloud resources built on Linux
    - AWS is world's largest public cloud provider 
## LXCs: the safest way to learn Linux skills 
- LXC container: use as a sandbox for learning on linux systems
- probably better to just use docker on my local machine 
    - `docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash`
    - `docker run -it alpine sh` 

# Linux System Architecture
## Identifying Hardware Peripherals 
- everything under /proc is under sysctl;
- everything under /sys under sysfs
    - newer fs that relies heavily on simlinks 
- under /dev, specific hardware devices are listed 
- info about physical devices are under /sys/class/ and /proc/sys/dev. /dev contains symbolic links to physical devices 
- linux kernel: core of the OS
    - to extend kernel's control, indivdual modules can be added and removed 
    - dbus message bus system 
- system management tools
    - init: in the beginning, served as air traffic control
        - can only control actions synchronously
    - Upstart: replaced init in 2006
    - systemd: replaced Upstart in 2015
## Managing Hardware Peripherals
- modules for most peripherals already installed in the os 
    - `lsmod` to list all modules in OS 
        - `lsmod | grep lp` to find all instances of the specific module 'lp'
        - `sudo modprobe -r lp` to remove the module 'lp'
            - can use `rmmod <module-name>` to remove module 
        - `sudo modprobe lp` to install module 'lp'
            - can use `insmod <module-name>` to install a module
    - `/lib/modules` is where all available modules on local machine are 
        - dirs are named after linux kernel releases 
            - older versions of the kernel and hardware modules are saved 
            - `uname` or `uname -r` to list OS and kernel version
        - list all available modules `find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -type f -iname "*.ko"`
- udev: linux dynamic device management 
    - rules locations 
        - `/etc/udev/rules.d`, `/run/udev/rules.d`, `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d`
            - read in that order 
        - file names include a number at the beginning to indicate the importance to read them. Lower value = higher preference 
- device naming (all managed by udev)
    - network interfaces: eth0, eth1, em0, em1, ...
    - hard disk drives (also SSD): sda, sdb, ...
        - partitions: sda1, sda2, sda3, ...
    - floppy drives: fd0, fd1, ...
    - CDRom/DVD drives: sr0, sr1, ...
    - `dmesg` to see current devices messages 
- aws instance metadata
    - `curl http://169.254.169.254:latest`
