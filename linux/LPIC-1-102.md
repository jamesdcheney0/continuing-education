# Linux Shells, Scripting, and Databases
## Shells 
### Working with Linux Shells 
- control shell profiles
    - login sessions
        - session when authentication is required to use; e.g. ssh
        - /etc/profile, and reads first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile 
    - non-login sessions 
        - session when authentication not required, e.g. iterm
        - system settings set by system settings 
        - `/etc/skel` - files from here will be copied to home folders of newly created users
        - /etc/bash.bashrc read first, then .bashrc
    - source/switch profiles with `source .bashrc` or `. .bashrc`
- create
    - shell variables
        - `user=myname` to create var in shell (system variable)
        - `export user` to create var in all child sessions (global variable)
        - `unset user` to remove var 
    - aliases
        - `alias` will list all aliases 
        - `alias printtz="cd /etc/;cat timezone"` to set alias `printtz` and runs the command 
        - `unalias printtz` to remove alias 
    - functions 
- execute multiple commands     
    - use lists to link commands together 
    - `&&`: 'and' - execute only if first command succeeds 
    - `;` run two different commands in all cases
    - `||`: 'or' - execute second command only if first command fails 
## Scripting
### Linux Scripts: The Basics
- plaintext files for automating administrative tasks
- 'shebang line': #!/bin/bash
- best practice is to add a comment on every line of a script 
- need executable permissions to run file `chmod +x file.sh`
- run script with `./file.sh`
- assumes inputs as strings
    - `declare -i variable` to make it a number
### Linux Scripts: Control Structures 
- if else statements must be closed with `fi` (backwards if)
- test for not equal: !=
- test for equal: =
- compare integers for equality `if test $number 1 -eq $number2; then`
    - test for equal: -eq
    - test for less than: -lt
    - test for greater than: -gt
- case `case $color in`: 'in the case $color is in the following options'
    - requires `;;` and `)`, but not `(`
    - ends with `esac`
    - can handle multiple conditions 
- while: execute while true
- until: execute until true
- for: execute against list items 
- seq: will count up in sequence
## Databases 
### MySQL
- tables, records, fields make up DBs
- `mysql -u <username> -p <password>`
    - every command requires a `;`
    - `show databases;` list DBs
    - `create database communications;` create new DB
    - `use communications;` work w specific DB
    - `show tables;`
    - `create table complaints (date DATE, email VARCHAR(20), message VARCHAR(250), response VARCHAR(250));` create table w/n DB
        - create table complaints with date, email, message, response headings, and define how many characters each one can have 
    - `insert into complaints...;` add data to table 
        - don't have to fill every field, but do have to define which fields are to be populated 
        - fields separated by `,` and not space
    - `select * from complaints;` view everything from complaints 
    - `select * from complaints where email='joe@cranky.com'` view data from specific email 
    - `delete * from complaints where email='joe@cranky.com'` 
    - `select * from complaints order by date;` to view all records in ascending order
    - `select * from complaints order by date DESC;` to view all records in descending order 
    - `select * from purchases, customers where purchases.customer = customers.id;`
        - view data from purchases, with corresponding records from a second DB listed on the right, but both joined together 
### The AWS Way
- login w  `mysql -h <rds endpoint> -u <user> -p <password>`
- can upload a db dump from localhost to RDS with `mysql -h <rds endpoint> -u <user> -p <remote db> < localdb.sql`


# Linux Desktops 
## Install and Configure Desktops
- install and configure X11
    - /etc/X11 contains config files for X11 
        - xorg.conf, cf86Config
        - ServerLayout combines all the peripherals together to be useful 
    - `echo $DISPLAY`: return display information 
    - `xdpyinfo`: provides info about all connected monitors
        - `xdpyinfo | less` to be able to read through better 
- `man ati`: provide overview of all ATI graphcs drivers, and can do the same for all graphics cards configs 
- `xhost +` enable graphic access to anyone
    - `-` to restrict access to only who has been allowed
    - `-/+ <ip.address>` to remove/add specific ip address
- `x font server`: doesn't do anything at all, but is an exam objective 
- `xwininfo`: display window information
- `Section "Screen"`: graphic system profile
- `Section "ServerLayout"`: total system profile
## Working with Display Managers
- XDM: x window display manager
    - started in 1988, mostly CLI
- GDM: gnome display manager
    - graphic replacement of XDM
- KDE
- lightDM
    - starts x-servers and login screens
    - very light compared to other display managers
    - resource files in /usr/shared/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/
    - configure files in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/ or /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf 
    - by default, guest user is able to login `allow-guest=false` to disable 
    - hide user list: `greeter-hide-users=false`
    - log specific user in automatically: `autologin-user=steve`
    - allow only guest login: `autologin-guest=true`
    - edit greeter using file from /usr/share/xgreeters/
    - run script at startup: `session-setup-script=command`
## Manage System Access Settings
- available options: orca screen reader, high contrast, large text, braille display, visual alerts, sticky keys, slow keys, bounce keys, repeat keys, mouse keys, hover click, on screen keyboard, able to install screen magnifying tool, but not necessarily a default thing included 
## Add a Graphic Interface to an AWS Instance 
- Need to use VNC on port 5901 
- ssh into the instance, then create new user who will own VNC session 
- add user to admin group 
- enable passwords over ssh
- `sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop`
- `sudo apt-get install vnc4server`
- `vncserver -kill` and edit xstartup file, may need to totally replace config, the restart vncserver 
- use remote desktop app to use VNC protocol to connect to instance 

# Linux Administration
## Users and Groups 
### Users
- `sudo useradd -m <user>` to create a user with a new user file in home 
    - `-p` to specify an encrypted password (doesn't take plaintext)
    - `-G` to add group membership
    - `-s` to specify default shell of user
- `sudo passwd <user>` to add password to user 
- `sudo userdel -r <user>` to delete user, their home dir, and the mail file`
- `sudo usermod <user>`
    - `-e` to set expiry
    - `-G` to add or remove group membership
    - `-l` to change login nmame
    - `-L` to lock password
    - `-U` to unlock password 
- `sudo chage --list <user>` list when user's account or passwords will expire 
    - `-m <days> <user>` to set min days until new password required
    - `-M <days> <user>` to set max days 
    - `-w <days> <user>` to set warning time 
### Groups 
- `sudo groupadd <name>`
- `sudo groupmod <name>`
- sudo adduser/addgroup in ubuntu provide more advanced management
- /etc/passwd 
- /etc/shadow: contains encrypted passwords and user expiry dates 
- `getent /etc/passwd <user>` to list info about user
- /etc/skel/* to define what should appear in user's home directories 
- /etc/group stores group data 
## Job Scheduling
- crontab
    - lives in /etc
    - checks cron.daily, cron.weekly, and cron.monthly scripts 
    - # m h dom mon dow user command 
        - minute
        - hour
        - day of month (* for daily)
        - month 
        - day of the week (sunday represented by 0 or 7)
    - can work on system.d systems with systemd timers 
    - /etc/anacrontab accounts for systems tha get turned off, and runs cron things a certain amount of times per month
    - all users can create jobs in /etc/cron.d
- `at` must first set time when to run the job, then the command to run. ctrl+d to run the configuration
    - list pending jobs with `atq`
    - `atrm <job number>` to remove a job
    - at.deny blacklists users, at.allow to whitelist 
    - pending jobs kept in /var/spool/cron
## Localisation 
- /etc/timezone contains current system timezone, also `date` to list current time 
- to update time, create a symlink between timezone info file and localtime dir, e.g. to set time to toronto:
    - `ls -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Toronto /etc/localtime` 
- or `tzselect`
- directly edit /etc/timezone
- timedatectl controls timezone info for system.d systems 
- `locale` to list current localisation variables 
    - `-a` to show all settings 
    - can use export to change for current session 
    - /etc/default/locale
