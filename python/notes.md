# Introduction info
- string concatenation: when `+` is used on two string values 
- print() [function]: displays string value within parenthises 
- input() [function]: waits for user to type text and press enter. String can be added inside to inform user of what to type
- len() [function]: evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in that string
- comparison operators [`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`]: compare two values and evaluate down to a single Boolean value. 
- boolean operators [`and`, `or`, `not`]: used to compare Boolean values
    - [`and`, `or`]: always take two values
    - [`not`]: evaluates to the opposite Boolean value
    - evaluated `not`, `and`, `or`

# If statements 
- if [statement]: 
    - clause [the block following the if statement]: will execute if the statement's condition is `True`
    - else [clause]: executed only when the if statement's condition is `False`
    - elif [statement]: always follows if or elif. Provides another condition that is checked ONLY if any of the previous conditions were False. Once a statement condition is `True`, remaining `elif` or `else` are skipped 
- while [statement]: make a block of code execute over and over again
    - Code in clause will execute as long as while statement's condition is `True`
    - aka `while loop` or `loop`
- break [statement]: force program executation to break out a while loop's clause early
    - contains the `break` keyword 
- continue [statement]: program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop and reevaluates the loop's condition (by default, happens when execution reaches end of loop)
- for [statement]: execute a block of code only a certain number of times
    - combined with range(int) 
    - e.g. `for i in range(5)`
- import [statement]: must import modules before using them
- sys.exit() [function]: cause program to terminate by calling
- def [statement]: defines a function
- arguments: values passed into functions by typing them between the ()
- parameter: variable that an argument is stored in when a function is called
- return value: value that a function call evaluates to
- return [statement]: specify what the return value should be. Requires `return` keyword and value or expression that function should return
- None [value]: represents the absence of a value. `None` is the only value of `NoneType` data type. 
- keyword arguments: identified by the keyword put before them in the function call; generally used for optional parameters
    - e.g. `print('Hello',end='')` `end=''` is the keyword argument 
- global [statement]: can be used to modify the global variable from w/n a function
    - e.g., w/n function: `global eggs` \ `eggs = spam` to reassign global `eggs` var
- try [clause]: for exception handling. Put code that could potentially have an error a return and tab under `try:`
- except [clause]: second part of exception handling. On the same column as `try:`; contains code to handle what happens when error occurs 

# Lists 
- list [data type]: a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence
    - index() [list method]: can be passed a value, and if that value exists in the list, the index of the value is returned
        - e.g. `spam.index('moose')`
    - append() [list method]: adds argument to end of list
        - e.g. `spam.append('moose')`
    - insert() [list method]: insert a value at any index in the list. First argument is index for new value, second argument is new value to be inserted
        - e.g. `spam.insert(1, 'chicken')`
    - remove() [list method]: pass the value to be removed from the list it is called on
        - e.g. `spam.remove('chicken')`
    - del [statement]: delete values at an index in a list
        - `del spam[1]`
    - sort() [list method]: sort list of number values or lists of strings
        - `spam.sort(reverse=True)` to sort in reverse order
        - sorts in ASCIIbetical order (capital alphabet first, then lowercase alphabet (e.g. A, B, ... Z, a, b, ... z))
            - `spam.sort(key=str.lower)` to sort in alphabetical order
- list [value]: refers to the list itself 
- items [value]: values inside a list; separated by commas 
- index: Integery inside the square brackets that follows the list. Can only be integer values
    - index values start at `0`
    - `-1`: index value that refers to last index in a list
    - `-2`: index value that refers to second-to-list index in a list (and so on)
- slice: obtain several values from a list, in the form of a new list
    - e.g. `[0:2]`; typed b/w square brackets w two integers seperated by `:`
    - first integer: index where the slice starts
    - second integer: index where the slice ends; goes up to but will not include the value at the second index
    - shortcuts: leaving out first index is same as starting from beginning of list; leaving out second index is same as using the length of the list
- list concatentation and replication
    - `+` can combine two lists to create a new list value
    - `*` used w list and integer value to replicate list 
- for loops w lists: a for loop repeats the code block once for each value in a list or list-like value
    - can use `range(len(<list>))` w a for loop to iterate over the indexes of a list 
- in & not in [operator]: connect two values: a value to look for in a list and the list where it may be found. Evaluates to Boolean
    - e.g. `spam = ['hello','hi','howdy','heyas] \ 'howdy' in spam`
- multiple assignment trick: assign multiple variables with the values in a list in one line of code
    - e.g. `cat = ['fat','black','loud'] \ size, color, disposition = cat`
        - the three vars on the end would be assigned values from list cat. Both have to be the same quantity of values 
- augmented assignment operators [`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%/`]: modify value and reassign to the same variable
    - e.g. `spam = 42 \ spam += 1 \ print(spam) \ 43`
- method: same thing as a function, except it is 'called on' a value
    - each data type has its own set of methods 
- tuple [data type]: typed with () and are immutable; cannot have their values modified, appended, or removed
    - to have only one value, place a trailing comma after the value inside the parenthese
- list() [function]: return a list of the values presented to it
- tuple() [function]: return a tuple of the values presented to it 
- reference: value that points to some bit of data
- list reference: value that points to a list
    - when assigning a list to a variable, actually assigning list reference to variable, not straight to the reference 
        - this means, by default what when modifying the original list (or dictionary), those changes would affect all lists based off that list (or dictionary)
            - copy.copy() [function]: to make a duplicate copy of a mutable value like a list or dictionary, not just a list reference
            - copy.deepcopy() [function]: if the list to copy contains lists that need to be copy, copy all of them (not their list references) with this function

# Dictionaries 
- dictionary [data type]: collection of many values using key-value pairs
    - keys() [dicionary method]: used to obtain keys from dictionary
    - values() [dicionary method]: used to obtain values from dictionary
    - items() [dicionary method]: used to obtain value and item pairs from dictionary 
    - get() [dicionary method]: takes two arguments, checks to see if a value is in a dictionary and if it's not, then a value to return when the expression returns False
    - setdefault() [dicionary method]: takes two arguments, the key to check for, and value to set at that key if the key doesn't exist
    - `dictionary[key] = value`: assign a value to a dictionary at the specified key 
- pprint [module]: helpful in pretty printing of dictionaries (among other things?)
    - pprint() [function]: pretty print a dictionary's values (e.g., newline between each dictionary value, and ASCIIbetically
    - pformat() [function]: obtain the prettified text as a string value instead of dictionary

# Manipulating Strings
- string values begin and end w a single quote
    - can begin and end w double quotes. W double quotes, `'` w/n string is ignored
- escape character: allow use of characters that are otherwise impossible to put into a string
    - `\'`: print `'`
    - `\"`: print `"`
    - `\t`: print tab
    - `\n`: print newline (line break)
    - `\\`: print `\`
- raw strings: place `r` before the beginning quotation mark of a string 
    - e.g. `print(r'That is Carol\'s cat.')` would return `That is Carol\'s cat.`
- multi-line strings: begins and ends w either three single quotes or three double quotes. Any quortes, tabs, or newlines between the triple quotes are considered part of the string
    - thus, using escape characters is optional in multi-line strings
- multi-line comments: can be made with a multi-line string; starting and ending with triple quotes
- strings use indexes and slices the same way lists do
    - if an index is specified, character at that position in the string will be returned
    - slicing a string does not modify original string
- `in` & `not in` operators can be used with strings just like w list values
    - e.g. `'Hello' in 'Hello world'`
## Useful string methods
- upper() [string method]: return a new string where all the letters in the original string have been converted to uppercase
- lower() [string method]: return a new string where all the letters in the original string have been converted to lowercase
    - e.g. `spam = 'Hello world!' \ spam = spam.upper() \ spam \ 'HELLO WORLD!'`
    - helpful to deal with user input and clean it up
        - e.g. `feeling = input() \ if feeling.lower() == 'great': \ ...` would be able to accept Great, GReat, etc and compare to `great`
- isupper() [string method]: return `True` if the string has at least one letter and all the letters are uppercase
- uslower() [string method]: return `True` if the string has at least one letter and all the letters are lowercase
    - otherwise, returns false 
- note: these methods do not change the string itself. Have to assign the method to the variable if wanting to preserve the change
- isalpha() [string method]: return `True` if the string consists only of letters and is not blank
- isalnum() [string method](stands for alphanumeric): return `True` if the string consists only have letters and numbers and is not blank
- isdecimal() [string method]: return `True` if the string consists only of numeric characters and is not blank
- isspace() [string method]: return `True` if the string consists only of spaces, tabs, and newlines and is not blank
- istitle() [string method]: return `True` if the string consists only of words that begin with an uppercase letter followed by only lowercase letters
- note: the isX string methods are helpful when needing to validate user input
- startswith() [string method]: return `True` if the string value begins with the string passed to the method
- endswith() [string method]: return `True` if the string value ends with the string passed to the method
- join() [string method]: join list of strings together into a single string value
    - called on a string, gets passed a list of strings, and returns a string
    - e.g. `', '.join(['cats','rats','bats']) \ 'cats, rats, bats'`
    - the string `join()` is called on is inserted between each string of the list argument
- rjust(), ljust() [string method]: returns a padded version of the string they are called on, with spaces inserted to justify the text
    - the first argument is the integer length of the justified string (includes the string, plus the amount of justification)
        - e.g. `'Hello'.rjust(10) \ '     Hello'` - Hello is five characters, so five spaces were added to the right
    - an optional second argument specified a fill character other than a space character
        - e.g. `'Hello'.rjust(10, '*') \ '*****Hello'`
- center() [string method]: centers the text, rather than justifying it
    - e.g. `'Hello'.center(20) \ '       Hello        '` - appears the higher number is put on the right side since the `20` can easily have `len(Hello)` subtracted from it 
- strip() [string method]: returns a string w/o any whitespace characters at the beginning or end
- lstrip(), rstrip() [string methods]: remove whitespace characters from the left and right ends, respectively
    - optionally, a string argument will specify which characters on the ends should be stripped 
        - e.g. `spam = 'SpamSpamBaconSpamEggsSpamSpam' \ spam.strip('ampS') \ 'BaconSpamEggs'`
        - the order of characters in the string passed to `strip()` doesn't matter
- pyperclip [module]:
    - copy() [function]: send text to clipboard 
    - paste() [function]: copy text from clipboard to use in program
