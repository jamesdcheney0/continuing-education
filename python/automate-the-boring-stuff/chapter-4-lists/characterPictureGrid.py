#     for i in range(len(grid)):
#         print(grid[j][i],end='')
#     print()

# I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!
# print(len(grid))
# print(len(grid[0]))

# listValues=range(len(grid[0]))
# for n in quantityOfLists:
#     for m in listValues:

for i in range(len(grid[0])): # `print(len(grid[0]))` returns 6 - the quantity inside each list (assumption is that they're all the same)
    for a in range(len(grid)):# `print(len(grid))` returns 9 - the length of lists - how many lists there are
        if a < len(grid)-1: # if the number of lists is less than the highest index of the list
            print(grid[a][i], end='') # print the first index first (the nested loop goes until it can't, then goes back to the big one, so the second index, which we want to change less only changes after all the first index positions have been iterated through
        else:
            print(grid[a][i]) #do that until the very last one to get rid of the % character that hangs around 

# many other commenters mentioned using zip and join
print('\n'.join(map(''.join, zip(*grid)))) # this does the same thing as the nested for loops
# zip(*grid) effectively transposes the `grid` matrix by flipping it on the main diagonal
# `''.join, zip(*grid)` then each row is joined into one string 
# `'\n'.join(map())` then the rows are joined with newlines 
# map() returns a list of the results after applying the given function. However, not recommended for production code in large projects.
