1. Functions break up programs into more manageable chunks
2. code in a function executes when the function is called
3. The `def` statement is used to define a function
4. a function contains the code to be run. A function call executes that code
5. there is one global scope, and a local scope per function
6. Variables in a local scope are forgotten when function call returns
7. Return values can be part of a function and give a result of the function
8. Functions without an explicit return statement return `None`
9. using `global <varName>` can access the global variable from the local scope
10. `None` data type is equivalent to `null`
11. `import areallyourpetsnamederic` would import the function `areallyourpetsnamederic`
12. Call the function `bacon()` in the imported module `spam` by calling `spam.bacon()`
13. Use `try` and `except` statements to handle exceptions and prevent program crashing
14. In the `try` clause the code that could fail is written. In the `except` statement, what to do in the event of an exception is defined
