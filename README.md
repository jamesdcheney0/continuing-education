# 1000 Hours
The world at large says it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. I am not aiming to do that here. This is to use my time more effectively by setting clear goals and accurately tracking training time. 

## The goals
Develop the following skills for approximately 1000 hours

|Python|AWS|Terraform|Terragrunt|Docker|Kubernetes|Linux|
|------|---|---------|----------|------|----------|-----|
|  350 |150|   100   |    100   |  100 |    100   | 100 |

- Python: Develop a GUI-based program that can be used for tracking my personal FIRE stats. Instead of using a amalgamation of online calculators and excel sheets, develop something that would record and track FIRE progress, investment account balances, calculate interest return, allow for scenarios to be generated based on information, and those scenarios be able to be changed after the fact, but the data still preserved
- AWS: Renew AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. Obtain AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification. By April 2024, renew AWS DevOps Professional certification. 
- Terraform: Obtain Hashicorp Terraform Associate certificate. Make some interesting and/or useful template
- Terragrunt: Once I have the basics of terraform down, develop a greater understanding of terragrunt since it is used so much day-to-day
- Docker: Obtain Docker Certified Associate
- Kubernetes: Obtain Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA) then Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) 
- Linux: Get a better grip on troubleshooting and navigating via the CLI. Develop skills and a personal wiki for vi & vim usage, performing common administrative tasks on Linux, and troubleshooting issues that arise.
